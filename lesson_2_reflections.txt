Q. - What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

A. - initializing a repository will allow me to make 
commits of the files in the repository. 

Q. - How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? What value
do you think it offers?
 
A. - The staging area allows one to group similar things
that one might want to commit together, while excluding 
other items that I may want to commit separately or 
not at all.
