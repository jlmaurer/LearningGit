Q. - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

A. - Using a remote repository would be useful when colloborating with others or 
using multiple computers to work on a project. In addition, keeping work in remote 
repository means that it can be accessed for others to use in their own projects.

Q. - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

A. - Manual syncing gives greater flexibility for how and when my github repo stays
updated. Maybe I have a number of commits that are all related to a single feature, 
so I only want to update github when the entire feature is finished. 

Q. - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A. - A branch is a linear set of commits in a git repository. A clone is a copy of 
a branch on my local machine, including all of the commits in that branch. A fork
is a clone of someone else's repository on github to my own github account. 

Q. - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A. - This way, changes that I commit locally can be compared to the state of the 
remote immediately, even without Internet access. I can keep track of the 
differences between the state on the remote, which could be changing due to my
collaborators, and my own local copy.
