Q. - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

A. - Using a remote repository would be useful when colloborating with others or 
using multiple computers to work on a project. In addition, keeping work in remote 
repository means that it can be accessed for others to use in their own projects.

Q. - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

A. - Manual syncing gives greater flexibility for how and when my github repo stays
updated. Maybe I have a number of commits that are all related to a single feature, 
so I only want to update github when the entire feature is finished.
